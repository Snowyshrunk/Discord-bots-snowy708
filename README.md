files of my discord bots

Snowflake
if you want to run this bot yourself you will need to change every where that there is `'REPLACE WITH CHANNEL ID'` with a channel id this is used for loging errors or where every you want error messages to go
(this only works for pycord errors not python errors)
you will also need to replace `BOT_TOKEN` with your bot token

Avalanche
this is the more complicated of the 2 bots start by doing the same as above then you will need to create some files within the same folder as the main.py file
name these files as shown below each file should have the exact same contence as the examples that you can find 
`whitelist.txt`
`blacklist.txt`
`assignment.json`
`assinment.txt`
upon doing this every thing should work as normal
