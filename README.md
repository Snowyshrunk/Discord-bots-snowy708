files of my discord bots

Snowflake
if you want to run this bot yourself you will need to change every where that there is `'REPLACE WITH CHANNEL ID'` with a channel id this is used for loging errors or where every you want error messages to go
(this only works for pycord errors not python errors)
you will also need to replace `BOT_TOKEN` with your bot token

Avalanche
this is the more complicated of the 2 bots start by doing the same as above then you will need to create some files within the same folder as the main.py file
name these files as shown below each file should have the exact same contence as the examples that you can find .
`whitelist.txt` for this it uses a discord user id i sugest you repace it with your id (keep the enter in th file or it wont work if you add another id to it).
`blacklist.txt` for this it uses a discord user id i sugest you repace it with one of some one you dont want using the bot.
`assignment.json` this cahes the server id and the chosent channle id probably best just to ad yours the the command /choose channel (if you want to).
`assinment.txt` this is where the details about the assignments are stored you dont need to do any other then copying the example with this file. 
upon doing this every thing should work as normal
